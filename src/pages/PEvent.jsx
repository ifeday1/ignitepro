              BACK TO SCHOOL INITIATIVE

              Ignite Pro Community Back to School Project 2025 Ignite Pro
              Community successfully held its first ever Corporate Social
              Responsibility (CSR) initiative, the “Back to School Project” at
              Elekahia Government Secondary School, Port Harcourt, Rivers State
              reaching out to 244 students in JSS3. The project was designed to
              give back to society, promote academic excellence, and inspire joy
              among students as they began a new academic session. As part of
              the initiative, we presented the students with school bags,
              exercise books, and mathematical sets to support their learning
              experience. The joy and gratitude expressed by the students were
              truly heartwarming, making it a deeply fulfilling experience for
              the entire team. This initiative reflects Ignite Pro Community’s
              ongoing commitment to empowering young minds and driving community
              development. We look forward to sustaining this impact through
              more meaningful CSR projects in the future.
